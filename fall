went to a Kanye West concert
went apple picking
went leaf-peeping
got lost in a corn maze
visited a pumpkin patch
played a game of touch football
went for a hike
collected colorful fall leaves
rented a cabin in the mountains
planted bulbs in your garden for next spring
ran a race
took a drive in the country
listened to the sound of leaves crunching under your feet
watched geese flying south for the winter
visited a petting zoo
made a pinecone bird feeder
collected pinecones and display them in a glass bowl
watched a kids’ soccer game
attended a fall festival
had a picnic
wrote down what you’re thankful for
made a scarecrow
jumped into a leaf pile
collected colorful leaves and press them into an album
took a hay ride
