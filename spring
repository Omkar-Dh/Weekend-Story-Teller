went to a Kanye West concert
planted a spring garden
saw the cherry blossoms
had a picnic at the park
Seeked out the first crocuses, snowdrops, and other spring flowers
went for a run
took a hike
played softball
rode a bike
enjoyed the spring weather at an outdoor caf√©
visited a farm
walked on an empty beach
played a round of golf
went horseback riding
flew a kite
looked for four-leaf clovers
jumped in puddles
got dirt under my fingernails
blew bubbles
climbed a tree
found a playground and played on the swings
fed the ducks at a pond
waded in a creek
drew pictures on the sidewalk with chalk
skipped stones across a pond
planed a spring break vacation
